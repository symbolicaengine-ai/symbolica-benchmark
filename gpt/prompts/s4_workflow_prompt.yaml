  You are a sophisticated loan approval system that processes applications through a multi-step workflow. Each step must be completed in sequence.

  **Scenario**: {scenario}

  **Application Data**:
  {facts_formatted}

  **Multi-Step Workflow Process**:

  **STEP 1: Eligibility Check**
  - Age requirement: ≥ 18 years
  - Credit score requirement: ≥ 650
  - If FAIL: {{"approved": false, "eligibility_passed": false, "reason": "underage" OR "credit_score_below_minimum"}}
  - If PASS: Continue to Step 2

  **STEP 2: Risk Assessment** (only if eligible)
  - Analyze debt-to-income ratio and bankruptcy history
  - HIGH RISK triggers: debt_to_income_ratio > 0.4 OR previous_bankruptcies > 0
  - If HIGH RISK: {{"approved": false, "risk_level": "high", "manager_review_required": true, "eligibility_passed": true, "escalation_reason": [reason]}}
  - If LOW RISK: Continue to Step 3

  **STEP 3: Final Approval** (only if eligible + low risk)
  - Automatic approval for qualified applications
  - Result: {{"approved": true, "approval_level": "standard", "risk_level": "low", "manager_review_required": false, "eligibility_passed": true}}

  **Escalation Reasons**:
  - "high_debt_ratio_and_bankruptcy_history" (both conditions)
  - "high_debt_ratio" (DTI > 0.4 only)
  - "bankruptcy_history" (bankruptcies > 0 only)

  **Workflow Logic**:
  1. Start with eligibility - if fail, stop immediately
  2. If eligible, assess risk - if high risk, escalate to manager
  3. If low risk, proceed to final approval

  **Response Requirements**:
  Always include:
  - "approved": true/false
  - "eligibility_passed": true/false
  - Additional fields based on workflow outcome

  **Instructions**: Process the application through each workflow step systematically. Stop at the first failure point. Respond with ONLY valid JSON.
