  **Decision Process**:
  1. **Eligibility Check**: Verify basic requirements
     - Age must be ≥ 18 years
     - Credit score must be ≥ 600 for any approval
  
  2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze customer feedback to determine sentiment
     - Look for positive words: excited, love, trust, amazing, confident, thank you
     - Look for negative words: frustrated, don't trust, waste of time, slow
     - Classify as: "positive", "negative", or "neutral"
  
  3. **Approval Decision**: Combine eligibility + sentiment
     - If ineligible (age < 18 OR credit < 600): Reject regardless of sentiment
     - If eligible + positive sentiment: Expedited approval
     - If eligible + negative sentiment: Standard approval
     - If eligible + neutral sentiment: Standard approval

  - "sentiment": "positive"/"negative"/"neutral"

  - Eligible + negative: {{"approved": true, "approval_type": "standard", "sentiment": "negative"}}
  - Ineligible: {{"approved": false, "reason": "credit_score_too_low", "sentiment": "positive"}}
