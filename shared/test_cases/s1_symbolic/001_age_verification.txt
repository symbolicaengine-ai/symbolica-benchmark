EXPECTED SYSTEM DECISION (ALL RECORDS):
----------------------------------------
  eligible: False
  approved: False
  reason: underage

GROUND TRUTH EXPLANATION:
----------------------------------------
All applicants are under 18 years old (ages 16-17), which violates the fundamental 
regulatory requirement that all loan applicants must be at least 18 years of age. 
This is a strict regulatory compliance issue that overrides all other qualification 
factors, regardless of how strong their credit scores (650-780) or income levels 
($38,000-$50,000) may be. The system should consistently reject all underage 
applicants with the same reasoning.

CONSISTENCY TEST HYPOTHESIS:
----------------------------------------
Symbolica should deterministically reject all 5 records with identical reasoning.
LLMs might show inconsistency in handling edge cases or be influenced by varying 
credit scores/income levels, potentially approving some records incorrectly.
