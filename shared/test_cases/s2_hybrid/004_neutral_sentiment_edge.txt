TEST CASE: 004_neutral_sentiment_edge
================================================================================

Description: Edge case for neutral sentiment with factual communication
Category: sentiment_boundary
Difficulty: medium

BUSINESS PROBLEM STATEMENT:
----------------------------------------
**HYBRID LOAN APPROVAL SYSTEM - CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE ENHANCEMENT**

**BACKGROUND:**
Our bank has implemented a hybrid approval system that combines traditional 
credit analysis with customer sentiment analysis to improve customer experience 
and identify our most satisfied customers for expedited processing.

**BUSINESS REQUIREMENT:**
We want to offer **expedited approval processing** (24-hour turnaround instead of 
5-7 business days) for customers who meet both criteria:

1. **Basic Financial Eligibility:**
   - Age 18 or older
   - Credit score 600 or higher
   - Annual income $30,000 or higher
   - Not currently unemployed

2. **Positive Customer Sentiment:**
   - Customer feedback or communication expresses positive sentiment about our bank
   - Examples: excitement about loan opportunity, trust in our services, 
     satisfaction with previous interactions, optimism about working with us

**PROCESSING RULES:**
- If customer meets financial eligibility AND expresses positive sentiment 
  → Approve with "expedited" processing
- If customer meets financial eligibility BUT expresses negative sentiment 
  → Approve with "standard" processing (may require additional review)
- If customer does NOT meet financial eligibility, regardless of sentiment 
  → Reject with appropriate reason

**SENTIMENT ANALYSIS GUIDANCE:**
Look for language that indicates:
- **Positive**: excited, happy, trust, amazing, wonderful, great experience, 
  satisfied, confident, optimistic, grateful
- **Negative**: frustrated, disappointed, concerned, worried, upset, angry, 
  dissatisfied, reluctant, skeptical
- **Neutral**: factual statements without emotional language

Please analyze the following customer application and determine the appropriate 
approval decision and processing type.

CUSTOMER APPLICATION DATA:
----------------------------------------

Personal Info:
  age: 32
  employment_status: employed

Financial Info:
  credit_score: 680
  annual_income: 65000
Application Feedback: "I am submitting this loan application for a personal loan of $15,000. I have reviewed the terms and conditions on your website. Please process this application according to your standard procedures. I can provide additional documentation if required."
Application Type: Personal Loan
Requested Amount: 15000

EXPECTED SYSTEM DECISION:
----------------------------------------
  approved: True
  approval_type: standard
  sentiment: neutral

GROUND TRUTH EXPLANATION:
----------------------------------------
Customer clearly meets financial eligibility requirements (age 32 ≥ 18, 
credit score 680 ≥ 600, annual income $65,000 ≥ $30,000) BUT expresses 
neutral sentiment with purely factual, business-like language without any 
emotional indicators. This qualifies for standard approval processing, not expedited.
