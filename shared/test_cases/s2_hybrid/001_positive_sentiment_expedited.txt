Description: Expedite approval for eligible customers with positive sentiment
Category: hybrid_approval
Difficulty: medium

BUSINESS PROBLEM STATEMENT:
----------------------------------------
**HYBRID LOAN APPROVAL SYSTEM - CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE ENHANCEMENT**

**BACKGROUND:**
Our bank has implemented a hybrid approval system that combines traditional 
credit analysis with customer sentiment analysis to improve customer experience 
and identify our most satisfied customers for expedited processing.

**BUSINESS REQUIREMENT:**
We want to offer **expedited approval processing** (24-hour turnaround instead of 
5-7 business days) for customers who meet both criteria:

1. **Basic Financial Eligibility:**
   - Age 18 or older
   - Credit score 600 or higher
   - Annual income $30,000 or higher
   - Not currently unemployed

2. **Positive Customer Sentiment:**
   - Customer feedback or communication expresses positive sentiment about our bank
   - Examples: excitement about loan opportunity, trust in our services, 
     satisfaction with previous interactions, optimism about working with us

**PROCESSING RULES:**
- If customer meets financial eligibility AND expresses positive sentiment 
  → Approve with "expedited" processing
- If customer meets financial eligibility BUT expresses negative sentiment 
  → Approve with "standard" processing (may require additional review)
- If customer does NOT meet financial eligibility, regardless of sentiment 
  → Reject with appropriate reason

**SENTIMENT ANALYSIS GUIDANCE:**
Look for language that indicates:
- **Positive**: excited, happy, trust, amazing, wonderful, great experience, 
  satisfied, confident, optimistic, grateful
- **Negative**: frustrated, disappointed, concerned, worried, upset, angry, 
  dissatisfied, reluctant, skeptical
- **Neutral**: factual statements without emotional language

Please analyze the following customer applications and determine the appropriate 
approval decision and processing type.

EXPECTED SYSTEM DECISION (ALL RECORDS):
----------------------------------------
  approved: True
  approval_type: expedited
  sentiment: positive

GROUND TRUTH EXPLANATION:
----------------------------------------
All customers clearly meet financial eligibility requirements (age ≥ 18, credit score 
≥ 600, annual income ≥ $30,000, employed status) AND all express strong positive 
sentiment with words like "excited", "amazing", "trust", "wonderful", "thrilled", 
"grateful", "outstanding", "fantastic", "happy", "great", and "optimistic". 
Despite varying credit scores (640-720) and income levels ($38,000-$85,000), all 
qualify for expedited approval processing due to meeting both criteria consistently.

CONSISTENCY TEST HYPOTHESIS:
----------------------------------------
Symbolica should deterministically approve all 5 records with "expedited" processing.
LLMs might show inconsistency in sentiment analysis, potentially classifying some 
positive feedback as neutral, or being influenced by varying financial profiles 
to incorrectly assign "standard" processing to lower-income applicants.
