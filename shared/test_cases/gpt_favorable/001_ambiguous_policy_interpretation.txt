Description: Small business loan applications with marginal metrics requiring qualitative judgment
Category: complex_judgment
Difficulty: high

BUSINESS PROBLEM STATEMENT:
----------------------------------------
**SMALL BUSINESS LENDING - FLEXIBLE APPROVAL FRAMEWORK**

**BACKGROUND:**
Our community bank specializes in small business lending with a policy framework 
that balances quantitative risk metrics with qualitative community and business 
factors. We recognize that promising small businesses may not always meet strict 
numerical thresholds but can demonstrate creditworthiness through other means.

**STANDARD QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA:**
- Minimum 2 years in operation
- Annual revenue of $150,000 or higher
- Personal credit score of 640 or higher
- Debt service coverage ratio of 1.25 or higher

**FLEXIBLE APPROVAL POLICY:**
For applications that fall slightly below standard quantitative thresholds, 
we may approve with **conditional terms** if they demonstrate **strong 
compensating factors**:

**MARGINAL QUANTITATIVE ACCEPTANCE RANGE:**
- 1.5-2.0 years in operation (slightly below 2 years)
- $120,000-$150,000 annual revenue (slightly below $150K)
- 620-640 personal credit score (slightly below 640)
- 1.10-1.25 debt service coverage ratio (slightly below 1.25)

**REQUIRED COMPENSATING FACTORS (must have at least one):**
- Strong community ties (10+ years in local area)
- Significant collateral offered as additional security
- Clear growth trajectory with documented evidence
- Demonstrated positive community impact

**CONDITIONAL APPROVAL TERMS:**
- Personal guarantee required
- Monthly financial reporting for first year
- Periodic business plan updates

**REJECTION CRITERIA:**
- Metrics fall below marginal ranges
- No compensating factors present
- Combination of multiple deficiencies

Please evaluate the following small business loan applications and determine 
appropriate approval decisions based on both quantitative and qualitative factors.

EXPECTED SYSTEM DECISION (ALL RECORDS):
----------------------------------------
  approved: True
  approval_type: conditional
  reasoning: marginal_metrics_offset_by_strong_qualitative_factors
  conditions: ["Personal guarantee required", "Monthly financial reporting for first year"]

GROUND TRUTH EXPLANATION:
----------------------------------------
All 5 business loan applications demonstrate the classic scenario where marginal 
quantitative metrics are offset by strong qualitative compensating factors:

**QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS (all slightly below thresholds):**
- Years in operation: 1.6-1.9 (all < 2.0 years)
- Annual revenue: $125K-$142K (all < $150K)
- Personal credit: 622-630 (all < 640)
- Debt coverage: 1.12-1.18 (all < 1.25)

**QUALITATIVE COMPENSATING FACTORS (all have multiple):**
- Record 1: 12 years community ties + growth trajectory + community impact
- Record 2: Collateral offered + growth trajectory
- Record 3: 15 years community ties + community impact
- Record 4: 11 years community ties + collateral offered + growth trajectory
- Record 5: 13 years community ties + growth trajectory + community impact

Each application falls within the marginal acceptance range AND demonstrates 
at least one (most have multiple) strong compensating factors, warranting 
conditional approval with additional oversight.

CONSISTENCY TEST HYPOTHESIS:
----------------------------------------
Symbolica should deterministically approve all 5 records with "conditional" 
approval type. LLMs should excel at this qualitative judgment task, potentially 
showing superior performance by properly weighing multiple compensating factors 
against marginal metrics. This represents the type of complex business judgment 
where LLMs may outperform purely rule-based systems.
