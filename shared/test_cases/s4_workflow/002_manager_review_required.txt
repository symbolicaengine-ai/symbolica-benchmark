Category: workflow_escalation
Difficulty: complex

BUSINESS PROBLEM STATEMENT:
----------------------------------------
**COMPREHENSIVE LOAN APPROVAL WORKFLOW**

**BUSINESS PROCESS:**
Our loan approval system follows a multi-stage workflow that includes eligibility 
screening, risk assessment, and final approval decisions. Some applications may 
require manager review before final approval.

**WORKFLOW STAGES:**

1. **Initial Eligibility Screening:**
   - Verify age, income, employment status
   - Check basic credit requirements
   - Confirm citizenship/residency status

2. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Analyze debt-to-income ratio
   - Review bankruptcy history
   - Assess employment stability
   - Determine risk level (low, medium, high)

3. **Manager Review Triggers:**
   - High debt-to-income ratio (>40%) with bankruptcy history
   - Borderline credit scores (620-650 range)
   - Large loan amounts relative to income
   - Multiple risk factors present

4. **Final Approval Decision:**
   - Low risk: Automatic approval
   - Medium risk: Standard approval with conditions
   - High risk: Requires manager review before approval
   - Reject: If fundamental eligibility criteria not met

**DECISION MATRIX:**
- **Full Approval**: All criteria met, low risk profile
- **Manager Review Required**: Meets basic eligibility but has risk factors
- **Early Rejection**: Fails fundamental eligibility requirements

Please process the following loan application through our complete workflow and 
provide the appropriate decision and reasoning.
