Description: Process multiple applications through full approval pipeline
Category: workflow_approval
Difficulty: medium

BUSINESS PROBLEM STATEMENT:
----------------------------------------
**MULTI-STEP LOAN APPROVAL WORKFLOW**

**BACKGROUND:**
Our bank implements a systematic multi-step workflow for loan approvals that ensures 
comprehensive risk assessment while maintaining efficient processing for qualified 
applicants. Each application must pass through sequential steps with specific 
criteria at each stage.

**WORKFLOW PROCESS:**

**STEP 1: ELIGIBILITY SCREENING**
- Age requirement: 18 years or older (regulatory compliance)
- Credit score requirement: 650 or higher (creditworthiness threshold)
- Income requirement: $50,000 or higher (debt service capability)
- Employment status: Must be employed (income stability)
- If any criterion fails → Immediate rejection with specific reason
- If all criteria pass → Continue to Step 2

**STEP 2: RISK ASSESSMENT**
- Analyze debt-to-income ratio and bankruptcy history
- **HIGH RISK TRIGGERS:**
  - Debt-to-income ratio > 40%
  - Previous bankruptcies > 0
- If HIGH RISK → Escalate to manager review (no automatic approval)
- If LOW RISK → Continue to Step 3

**STEP 3: FINAL APPROVAL**
- Applications that pass eligibility and risk assessment
- Receive automatic standard approval
- No additional review required

**ESCALATION REASONS:**
- "high_debt_ratio_and_bankruptcy_history" (both conditions present)
- "high_debt_ratio" (DTI > 40% only)
- "bankruptcy_history" (previous bankruptcies > 0 only)

**DECISION OUTCOMES:**
- Standard approval: All criteria met, low risk profile
- Manager review: Eligible but high risk factors present
- Rejection: Failed eligibility screening

Please process the following loan applications through the complete workflow.

EXPECTED SYSTEM DECISION (ALL RECORDS):
----------------------------------------
  approved: True
  approval_level: standard
  risk_level: low
  manager_review_required: False
  eligibility_passed: True

GROUND TRUTH EXPLANATION:
----------------------------------------
All 5 customer records successfully pass through the complete 3-step workflow:

**Step 1 - Eligibility (ALL PASS):**
- All ages 28-35 ≥ 18 ✓
- All credit scores 680-720 ≥ 650 ✓  
- All incomes $62,000-$85,000 ≥ $50,000 ✓
- All employed full-time ✓

**Step 2 - Risk Assessment (ALL LOW RISK):**
- All debt-to-income ratios 0.25-0.35 ≤ 0.40 ✓
- All have 0 previous bankruptcies ✓

**Step 3 - Final Approval (ALL QUALIFY):**
- All applications meet standard approval criteria
- No manager review required
- Automatic approval granted

Despite varying credit scores, income levels, and debt ratios, all customers 
consistently fall within acceptable ranges for standard approval.

CONSISTENCY TEST HYPOTHESIS:
----------------------------------------
Symbolica should deterministically approve all 5 records with identical "standard" 
approval decisions. LLMs might show inconsistency in multi-step processing, 
potentially failing to properly sequence the workflow steps or being influenced 
by minor variations in profiles to incorrectly escalate some applications for 
manager review.
