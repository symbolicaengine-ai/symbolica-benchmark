TEST CASE: 003_normal_spending_pattern
================================================================================

Description: Normal spending pattern should not trigger fraud alerts
Category: normal_activity
Difficulty: simple

BUSINESS PROBLEM STATEMENT:
----------------------------------------
**FRAUD DETECTION SYSTEM - TEMPORAL ANALYSIS**

**BACKGROUND:**
Our fraud detection system monitors customer transaction patterns over time to 
identify potentially fraudulent activity. We need to analyze recent transaction 
history and geographic patterns to determine if transactions should be flagged 
for fraud review.

**TEMPORAL ANALYSIS RULES:**

1. **Sustained High Spending Pattern:**
   - If customer has multiple high-value transactions (>$1000) within a short timeframe
   - AND transactions are significantly above their normal spending pattern
   - AND the pattern persists over multiple days
   → Flag as potential fraud

2. **Geographic Velocity Pattern:**
   - If customer makes transactions in multiple distant locations within impossible timeframes
   - OR transactions occur in known high-risk geographic areas
   - OR rapid movement between significantly distant locations
   → Flag as potential fraud

3. **Normal Spending Pattern:**
   - If transactions are within normal spending ranges for the customer
   - AND geographic patterns are consistent with customer's typical behavior
   - AND no suspicious velocity or amount patterns
   → Continue normal processing

**ANALYSIS CRITERIA:**
- Review transaction amounts, times, and locations
- Compare against customer's historical spending patterns
- Consider geographic feasibility of transaction sequence
- Look for sudden changes in spending behavior

Please analyze the following customer transaction data and determine if fraud 
investigation is warranted.
