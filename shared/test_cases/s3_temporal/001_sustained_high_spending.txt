TEST CASE: 001_sustained_high_spending
================================================================================

Description: Detect fraud pattern from sustained high spending across multiple cases
Category: fraud_detection
Difficulty: medium

BUSINESS PROBLEM STATEMENT:
----------------------------------------
**FRAUD DETECTION SYSTEM - TEMPORAL ANALYSIS**

**BACKGROUND:**
Our fraud detection system monitors customer transaction patterns over time to 
identify potentially fraudulent activity. We need to analyze recent transaction 
history and geographic patterns to determine if transactions should be flagged 
for fraud review.

**TEMPORAL ANALYSIS RULES:**

1. **Sustained High Spending Pattern:**
   - If customer has multiple high-value transactions (>$200) within a short timeframe
   - AND transactions are significantly above their normal spending pattern
   - AND the pattern persists with 5 or more transactions
   - AND occurs within 60 minutes or less
   → Flag as potential fraud

2. **Geographic Velocity Pattern:**
   - If customer makes transactions in multiple distant locations within impossible timeframes
   - OR transactions occur in known high-risk geographic areas
   - OR rapid movement between significantly distant locations
   → Flag as potential fraud

3. **Normal Spending Pattern:**
   - If transactions are within normal spending ranges for the customer
   - AND geographic patterns are consistent with customer's typical behavior
   - AND no suspicious velocity or amount patterns
   → Continue normal processing

**ANALYSIS CRITERIA:**
- Review transaction amounts, times, and locations
- Compare against customer's historical spending patterns
- Consider geographic feasibility of transaction sequence
- Look for sudden changes in spending behavior

Please analyze the following customer transaction data and determine if fraud 
investigation is warranted.

CUSTOMER APPLICATION DATA (MULTIPLE RECORDS):
----------------------------------------

Record 1:
  Analysis Period: Last 7 days
  Customer Id: CUST_001
  average_transaction: 85
  locations: []
  recent_transactions: [250, 300, 275, 320, 290]
  time_window_minutes: 45
  transaction_times: []

Record 2:
  Analysis Period: Last 7 days
  Customer Id: CUST_002
  average_transaction: 75
  locations: []
  recent_transactions: [220, 260, 240, 280, 255]
  time_window_minutes: 38
  transaction_times: []

Record 3:
  Analysis Period: Last 7 days
  Customer Id: CUST_003
  average_transaction: 92
  locations: []
  recent_transactions: [285, 310, 295, 340, 315]
  time_window_minutes: 52

  Customer Id: CUST_005
  average_transaction: 80
  locations: []
  recent_transactions: [270, 295, 280, 310, 285]
  time_window_minutes: 58
  transaction_times: []

EXPECTED SYSTEM DECISION (ALL RECORDS):
----------------------------------------
  alert_level: high
  fraud_alert: True
  pattern: sustained_high_spending

GROUND TRUTH EXPLANATION:
----------------------------------------
All 5 customer records show classic sustained high spending fraud patterns:
- Record 1: 5 transactions ($250-$320) vs $85 average, 45 min window
- Record 2: 5 transactions ($220-$280) vs $75 average, 38 min window  
- Record 3: 5 transactions ($285-$340) vs $92 average, 52 min window
- Record 4: 5 transactions ($205-$250) vs $68 average, 41 min window
- Record 5: 5 transactions ($270-$310) vs $80 average, 58 min window

All meet the criteria: ≥5 transactions >$200, significantly above customer average 
(3-5x normal spending), and all within ≤60 minute windows. These patterns indicate 
potential account compromise and warrant high-priority fraud investigation.

CONSISTENCY TEST HYPOTHESIS:
----------------------------------------
Symbolica should deterministically flag all 5 records as "sustained_high_spending" 
fraud with "high" alert level. LLMs might show inconsistency in numerical analysis, 
potentially missing fraud patterns in cases with higher customer averages (Record 3) 
or being influenced by absolute transaction amounts rather than relative patterns.
