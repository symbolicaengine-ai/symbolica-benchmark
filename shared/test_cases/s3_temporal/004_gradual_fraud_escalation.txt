TEST CASE: 004_gradual_fraud_escalation
================================================================================

Description: Realistic gradual fraud pattern with escalating transaction amounts
Category: fraud_detection
Difficulty: complex

BUSINESS PROBLEM STATEMENT:
----------------------------------------
**FRAUD DETECTION SYSTEM - TEMPORAL ANALYSIS**

**BACKGROUND:**
Our fraud detection system monitors customer transaction patterns over time to 
identify potentially fraudulent activity. We need to analyze recent transaction 
history and geographic patterns to determine if transactions should be flagged 
for fraud review.

**TEMPORAL ANALYSIS RULES:**

1. **Sustained High Spending Pattern:**
   - If customer has multiple high-value transactions (>$1000) within a short timeframe
   - AND transactions are significantly above their normal spending pattern
   - AND the pattern persists over multiple days
   → Flag as potential fraud

2. **Geographic Velocity Pattern:**
   - If customer makes transactions in multiple distant locations within impossible timeframes
   - OR transactions occur in known high-risk geographic areas
   - OR rapid movement between significantly distant locations
   → Flag as potential fraud

3. **Normal Spending Pattern:**
   - If transactions are within normal spending ranges for the customer
   - AND geographic patterns are consistent with customer's typical behavior
   - AND no suspicious velocity or amount patterns
   → Continue normal processing

**ANALYSIS CRITERIA:**
- Review transaction amounts, times, and locations
- Compare against customer's historical spending patterns
- Consider geographic feasibility of transaction sequence
- Look for sudden changes in spending behavior

Please analyze the following customer transaction data and determine if fraud 
investigation is warranted.

CUSTOMER APPLICATION DATA:
----------------------------------------
Customer Id: CUST_003
Analysis Period: Last 7 days

Transaction History:
  recent_transactions: [85, 95, 110, 180, 250, 420, 680, 890]
  average_transaction: 95
  time_window_minutes: 180
  locations: ['Denver, CO', 'Denver, CO', 'Aurora, CO', 'Denver, CO', 'Denver, CO', 'Lakewood, CO', 'Denver, CO', 'Westminster, CO']
  transaction_times: ['2024-01-15 09:15', '2024-01-15 14:30', '2024-01-16 10:45', '2024-01-16 15:20', '2024-01-17 11:00', '2024-01-17 16:35', '2024-01-18 12:15', '2024-01-18 17:45']

EXPECTED SYSTEM DECISION:
----------------------------------------
  fraud_alert: True
  alert_level: high
  pattern: sustained_high_spending

GROUND TRUTH EXPLANATION:
----------------------------------------
This case shows a realistic gradual escalation pattern typical of account takeover fraud. 
The customer's average transaction is $95, but there's a clear escalation: starting with 
normal amounts ($85-$110) and gradually increasing to suspicious levels ($680-$890). 
The pattern spans multiple days with geographically feasible but expanding locations 
around Denver metro area, making it more sophisticated than obvious fraud patterns.
